### Hi there üëã, I'm Md Shahid Afridi

> A Data Scientist and Machine Learning professional, I recently completed my MS in Big Data Analytics from the Central University of Rajasthan. With a solid foundation in statistical modeling, predictive analytics, Python, and SQL, I have hands-on experience building data-driven solutions for real-world problems. My professional experience includes working as a freelance Prompt Engineer for LLM-based AI agent development and conducting applied research on early Alzheimer's disease detection using MRI data. I am passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that support business decision-making and innovation.
